# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Recommendation System â€“ Ensemble Approach  

This project is inspired by the **legendary Netflix Prize competition (2006)**, where the challenge was to predict user ratings and improve movie recommendations.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ What this project does
- Builds a **movie recommendation engine** using collaborative filtering + deep learning  
- Combines **SVD (matrix factorization)**, **KNN similarity**, and an **Autoencoder**  
- Blends predictions with a **Ridge Regression ensemble** to boost accuracy  
- Evaluates using **RMSE** to measure recommendation quality  
- Generates **Top-N personalized movie suggestions**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- **MovieLens 100k (demo)** â†’ can be scaled to Netflix Prize dataset  
- Format: `user_id, movie_id, rating`  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results
- Base models (SVD / KNN / Autoencoder): **RMSE ~1.07**  
- Ensemble (stacking): **slightly improved RMSE**  
- Shows how blending multiple models improves personalization  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)  
- **Surprise** (SVD, KNNBaseline)  
- **PyTorch** (Autoencoder)  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Run the project
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy surprise torch
python netflix_like_ensemble.py
